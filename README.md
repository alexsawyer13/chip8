## Todo
Fix SDL building with cmake

Assembler / disassembler

Chip-48 extension

Implement more platforms

Allow save/load states

Add some more debug features using keyboard
- Speed up tickrate
- Slow down tickrate
- Pause emulation
- Print debug text on screen using SDL
- Maybe make screen bigger and contain chip-8 within a subsection of it to include this
- Maybe use imgui
